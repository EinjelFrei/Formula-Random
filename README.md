# FORMULA RANDOM #

THIS APPLICATION RANDOMLY GENERATES AN (unrealistic) FORMULA ONE™ RACE! This creates a text file with the starting conditions of
the race, and a CSV file with every single event that happens in the race.

The fileless version of this app does the same thing as the "filed" one, but doesn't write any files.

If you find any bugs, please report them in the Issues tab.

Feel free to use this as you will, but credit is appreciated ;)
